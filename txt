136,585 USDT was received from broker ‘~Nueve’, utilising the Tron blockchain as payment 
for the substituted cocaine. Blockchain tracing analysis identified the funds moved through 
several wallets, it is likely WALLET 4 - TY8fRP6aCcWnJ7qjarHuz3iWFKY4CmW6yS,  
financed the purchase. Review of transactions between intermediary wallets contained links 
to cryptocurrency exchange Binance.com. The ownership of the intermediary wallets and 
WALLET 4 is currently unknown.

investigate/target a transnational criminal organisation (TCO) seeking to supply 2,400 
kilograms of cocaine into Western Australia (WA) and Queensland (QLD). 
2. At 0200hrs on 28 December 2022, TSOCS delivered 1,200 kilograms offshore to the pre-
arranged ‘drop point’. On 31 December 2022, Op BEECH proceeded to the resolution 
phase, with nine offenders being arrested and charged. 
3. The remaining 1,200 kilograms are being utilised in an alternative covert strategy - 
Operation BEECH ALPHA 22LK. 
4. WAPF UPU has engaged in WhatsApp communications with an unknown entity utilising 
the handle '~Nueve' regarding collecting the substituted cocaine. 
5. Payment of the substituted cocaine has agreed to occur via cryptocurrency USDT-TRON 
(TRC20), with WAPOL covert wallet address provided to '~Nueve'.

APPENDIX – KEY TERMS AND DEFINITIONS 
 
Term  Definition  
Blockchain   A type of distributed ledger technology that organises digital data in 
blocks, which are linked using cryptography. The database can be 
managed centrally or collectively. When managed collectively, a 
peer-to-peer network of computers (called ‘nodes’) must reach 
consensus on the validity of a block. When consensus is reached, 
the block is ‘chained’ to the previous one using a cryptographic 
signature. Once a new block is added, all existing copies of the 
database within the network are updated.   
Blockchain analysis   The process of identifying, mapping and analysing data recorded on 
blockchains, often by using specific software. Certain companies are 
well known for their blockchain analysis, such as Chainalysis and 
CipherTrace.   
Chainalysis   A non-government, international software company which specialises 
in comprehensive solutions to cryptocurrency investigation and 
transaction monitoring.    
Cold Wallet A digital cryptocurrency wallet stored on a platform not connected to 
the internet. It is also referred to as Hardware wallet or cold storage.  
Cryptocurrency   A non-fiat convertible virtual currency that is decentralised, protected 
by cryptography (a method for securing communication using code) 
and exchanged directly between two parties online. Cryptocurrencies 
are made up of ‘coins’, which are pieces of computer code that 
represent a monetary unit and require public and private cryptographic 
keys to be traded.   
Digital Currency 
Exchange   A person or business entity allowing customers to exchange and 
trade virtual currency for fiat, funds, or other forms of virtual currency 
or precious metals fo r a fee (i.e. Independent Reserve).   
Distributed Ledger 
Technology   A digital system for recording and sharing data across multiple data 
stores (or ledgers) that allows for transactions to be recorded, shared 
and synchronised across a network of participants.  
Fiat currency   A currency not linked directly to the value of a commodity but is 
established as money by government regulation. It has an assigned 
value determined by the issuing government (for example, the 
Australian dollar).   
Hot Wallet A digital cryptocurrency wallet stored usually stored on computer on 
phones which is connected to the internet. Some exchanges will offer 
a separate hot wallet in addition to keeping crypto on their exchange. 
Keys – Public and 
Private   Public Key  – A public key is a published number used to encrypt and 
check signed messages or transactions. In relation to cryptocurrency, 
the hash of a public key is known as the wallet address and is similar 
to the use of a Bank-State-Branch (BSB) together with an account 
number to identify a particular bank account.  
  
Private Key  – Related to the public key, private keys are secret and 
used to decrypt and sign messages or transactions. A private key is 
similar to a password which accesses a person’s bank account online 
and can be made into a Quick Reference (QR) barcode for storage.  
  
TRON Is a blockchain based decentralised digital platform with its own 
cryptocurrency. It was founded in 2017 by the Tron Foundation. Its PROTECTED
